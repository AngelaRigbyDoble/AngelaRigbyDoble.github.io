				<p>Ever since I knew how I wrote compulsively, undeterred as a child by sibling parody, or as
		an adult by the risk of my diaries getting into the wrong hands. I have written articles,

				<h3>The deep darkness of love</h3>
	<p>I still have a few copies left of my collection, <i>The deep darkness of love</i>, price £5.00 +
	postage and packing.
	A new edition will be available on Amazon soon.
	Also, look out for a new collection, based on the experience of neurodivergent people’s
	partners.

	<br></br> Below are some poems from The deep darkness of love which I won prizes for:</p>

        		<summary>And the whole house was filled</summary>
					<p>
						He was back,
						and the whole house
						was full of it, roast meat, baked bread - 

						our brother too,
						back from death, the stink
						only now completely washed away,

						lounged and laughed,
						eating and drinking by his side,
						glowing with life and clean sweat.

						My secret,
						costing everything I had, lay sealed
						in an alabaster bottle, hidden in my cloak.

						I snapped the neck
						and poured the unexpected perfume
						over his male-smelling head, his warm hands, smoothed his feet.

						Breath-taking,
						it rose through the whole house
						like lamplight or music, sweetness we will never
						savour again.
						He smiled and understood,
						wouldn’t let them criticise, gave my impulse-buy

						profound meaning.
						I knelt before him in tears, all of us
						and the feasting house to its roof filled with him.

						<i>This poem won an American award for excellence in poetry</i>

					<i>‘A cat is considered by law to be property. If you find a stray and keep it, you can be
			       convicted of theft.’
					(Notice in Ealing)</i>

					The runaway cats you see on posters
					end up here. ‘I just need,’ they say,
					nosing round the door of my shed,
					‘some space,’ slinking in,
					‘to get my head back together.’
					‘And I’m “not required for breeding”,’
					they add, curving around my leg.
					There is usually one curled up
					on the perished felt of the roof,
					another marking time under the apple tree
					by the old bath. And who knows
					how many in the bramble patch.
					‘We want Millicent back!’
					yells 020 8443 9705,
					stung by unaccustomed pain.
					‘Sightings in the allotment area.
					Reward offered.’

					I unscrew the thermos
					and sit in my doorway, dreaming
					of my reward. A new shed? Maybe
					a proper greenhouse? The late afternoon sun
					puts haloes on bean-rows and chrysanthemums,
					blackberries and weeds, half-blinding me.
					A Persian is watching
					from the next plot’s shadow, a ghost
					trailing soft white streamers,
					with small unhappy eyes.
					‘I’m Millicent,’ she murmurs,
					and the sun moves, gilding her suddenly,
					and lighting up stained-glass windows
					in a number of tumble-down sheds.
					With a sigh I forget about wealth,
					and risk my freedom
					with a saucer of milk.

        	<summary>Painting class</summary>
        		<p>
					The art of watercolour
					is to let the light
					shine through.

					Lay on transparent colours,
					wash after jewel-like wash,
					viridian, cobalt blue,
					rose madder -
					underneath I can still see
					disappointment,
					emptiness,
					fear of the future.

					Lay on the opaque colours,
					yellow ochre,
					cadmium red,
					cadmium yellow -
					underneath I cannot see
					the way ahead,
					the hand, the face
					of God.

					Everything around me
					looks like a painting -
					the cerulean sky,
					lemon yellow sun,
					sea, Prussian blue.
					But on my paper,
					layer on muddy layer;
					I have tried too hard.

					Scrub it off, start again!
					That is the art,
					to let the light shine through
					even the darkest shade,
					ultramarine,
					burnt umber,
					Paynes gray.
